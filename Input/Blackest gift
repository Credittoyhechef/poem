the blackest gift



It is a night of ethereal pain, a song of dark desire,
Wolves vent their bloodlust,
The beautiful one awakens.
Wisps of death shrouds her stalking form,
an everlasting desire. Her
raven hair cascades over pale
shoulders, and her full deeply crimson lips part slightly,
to taste the essence streaming from the weakened flesh
beneath her. Now a night of ecstasy, I smile vaguely.
