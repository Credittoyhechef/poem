Dear Devil's Queen,

I have a small confession. Forgive this pouring of my heart.

I cherish the lake, where we first met. The moment I clapped eyes on you, I knew you were going to be a trendy lover. Recently, I have began to regard you as much more than just a trendy lover.

My feelings for you intensified when I saw you dancing in the moonlight. I was further wowed by your tremendous hugging skills.

You have eyes like fiery apple and the most naughty face I've ever seen. When I look at you, I just want to admire those fiery apple eyes and love that naughty face.

You're so special with your sexy ways. The way you handle your amazing puppy shows great professionalism and kindness.

I know that to you I'm just a false idiot but I think we could be happy together, singing like two crazy puppies.

Please, say you'll be mine Devil's Queen!

All my love
