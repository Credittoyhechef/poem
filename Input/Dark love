Verse 1
I love sleeping by your side
Agony and suffering
Nothing to hate, no nothing to fear
Searching for a brighter day, on this dark and lonely night

Pre-Chorus
Finding the answer is my way
To find proof of my love

Chorus
Hide in dark silence, find a place to stay by the fire
Hide in dark silence, find a place to lay down by the fire
My soul is crying for tomorrow
The light of love is dying despite my eyes

Verse 2
We come from an ancient land
For you to cleanse the planet
For peace and love and security
The one you love the most yet never met

Pre-Chorus
A dark shadow
To guide me through this land

Chorus
Hide in dark silence, find a place to stay by the fire
Hide in dark silence, find a place to lay down by the fire
My soul is crying for tomorrow
The light of love is dying despite my eyes

Bridge
Go on and live in sin
Without the love of other

Chorus
Hide in dark silence, find a place to stay by the fire
Hide in dark silence, find a place to lay down by the fire
My soul is crying for tomorrow
The light of love is dying despite my eyes
