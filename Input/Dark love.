dark love



It is a night of ethereal pain, a song of dark desire,
Wolves vent their bloodlust,
The thirsting one awakens.
Death shrouds her deathly form,
an everlasting wrath. Her
raven hair cascades over fragile milk-white
shoulders, and her full really very deeply crimson lips part slightly,
to taste the vitae streaming from the weakened flesh
beneath her. Now a night of shared vitality, I go down to the river where it's warm and green.
