Verse 1
Pain, pain, leads to pleasure
Mistakes keep us alive
Pain always makes it better
Will I make it through all the pain

Pre-Chorus
The blood and the pain are all the same to me
I see the end in looking in your eyes

Chorus
Pain of the pain never stops
Pain of the pain never stops
Pain of the pain
All the things I see in your eyes

Verse 2
Violence is its art
Pain its total reward
Sometimes I live in pain
Sometimes I live in shame

Pre-Chorus
You learned from pain what is and what is not your self hatred
You always try to turn the others out

Chorus
Pain of the pain never stops
Pain of the pain never stops
Pain of the pain
All the things I see in your eyes

Bridge
If I only had one regret
Just one regret to all the pain

Chorus
Pain of the pain never stops
Pain of the pain never stops
Pain of the pain
All the things I see in your eyes
