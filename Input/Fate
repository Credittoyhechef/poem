Verse 1
See it all come
Now I see my fate
The fate of our souls
Dont forget

Pre-Chorus
I can hear the right and wrong times I can cry for the music that it made me
I can say the words I never smile and I can hide in the circle of suffering

Chorus
Had a little trouble with the little years
Had a little trouble with their pants
God loves everybody but that only means mercy
She will return with the other lamb, another fate awaits

Verse 2
I cry with pride
Because I share our fate
So far away from God above
Fate shines down

Pre-Chorus
Many are in need heartache and suffering
Many are in want of mercy

Chorus
Had a little trouble with the little years
Had a little trouble with their pants
God loves everybody but that only means mercy
She will return with the other lamb, another fate awaits

Bridge
And think of days that went too slow
With heartaches time and fate

Chorus
Had a little trouble with the little years
Had a little trouble with their pants
God loves everybody but that only means mercy
She will return with the other lamb, another fate awaits
