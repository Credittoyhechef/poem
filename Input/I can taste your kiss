I Can Taste Your Kiss

Verse 1
For some folks you get a brand new job

Some folks they move from house to house

I think you need a little time off

Well I can work once every few months when you're out

Just give me a little time off from all this pain

All those folks they gettin you caught in the act


Chorus
Well when I'm not in a fight you always win

Just give me a little time off these nights

I got everything I need I just can't wait

You know I need you and that's it


Verse 2
Lying here you're not getting any love

I can comb your hair I can crawl through your bed

I can taste your kiss

But I'm only dreaming of you

There's no way out of this land

There's no way out of this land


Chorus
Well when I'm not in a fight you always win

Just give me a little time off these nights

I got everything I need I just can't wait

You know I need you and that's it
