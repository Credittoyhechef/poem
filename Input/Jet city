Verse 1
The woman I loved, since I was young
Baby girl could not see me as I was inside
An evil hiding dark from her eyes
My soul was taken, until Baby girl burned in smoke

Pre-Chorus
Dont hate me
Baby girl made me stronger

Chorus
The path, will be mine
The sunshine city, ah
And the screams still descend upon the shadows of the past
That the tears Baby girl cried would be washed away in vain

Verse 2
Babygirl sends me pictures of her world
I never take time to understand her
There is mist in the air
That speaks of clearing feet the fresh scent of morning

Pre-Chorus
Now just like a drowning woman
I drown in your ego

Chorus
The path, will be mine
The sunshine city, ah
And the screams still descend upon the shadows of the past
That the tears Jet cried would be washed away in vain

Bridge
I feel free now, on a crowded sidewalk in the city
I step up, you take it away

Chorus
The path, will be mine
The sunshine city, ah
And the screams still descend upon the shadows of the past
That the tears Babygirl cried would be washed away in vain
