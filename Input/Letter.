Dear Devil's Queen,

I have a small confession. Forgive this pouring of my heart.

I cherish Camp, where we first met. The moment I clapped eyes on you, I knew you were going to be a trendy wife. Recently, I have began to regard you as much more than just a trendy wife.

My feelings for you intensified when I saw you loving in the moonlight. I was further wowed by your tremendous singing skills.

You have eyes like sexy strawberry and the most terrifying heart I've ever seen. When I look at you, I just want to kiss those sexy strawberry eyes and hug that terrifying heart.

You're so special with your teasing ways. The way you handle your moist puppy shows great humility and chastity.

I know that to you I'm just a fiery fool but I think we could be happy together, spinning like two amazing humming birds.

Please, say you'll be mine Devil's Queen!

All my love
King Lucifer
