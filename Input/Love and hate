Verse 1
And if I lose any more time
Such a love, to understand
I cry, I cry, no one else can help me please
Lord, I wanna fall, I wanna fall, in love

Pre-Chorus
Ashes of the honeymoon
You see what those love events suddenly showed

Chorus
These could be the songs of love
These could be the songs of love
These could be the songs of love
It was in the garden where our first love died

Verse 2
This is me used to be
This is me tired and alone
Nobody will ever love me like this
Nobody will ever love me like you do

Pre-Chorus
Everybody knows our love is strong
Nobody needs the truth

Chorus
These could be the songs of love
These could be the songs of love
These could be the songs of love
It was in the garden where our first love died

Bridge
Once I had a love but he in my way
He played me around like a card game

Chorus
These could be the songs of love
These could be the songs of love
These could be the songs of love
It was in the garden where our first love died
