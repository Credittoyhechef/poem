Verse 1
Babe, everything in natural colours
Babe, I want to feel your love
Hate to let this end this way
So many tales are bound to be

Pre-Chorus
The warrior of the forgotten soul, hail!
Fight for the unborn hate, lord!

Chorus
Hate for love, is already inside
Hate for love, is already on
Tell it like you want it
Hate for love, is already inside

Verse 2
This raging fury consumes me with hate
Within this violent shell
Touch your lips and hold you in
Remember that I still love you

Pre-Chorus
Life has been harsh and I feel old
My only memory is that trick of the light

Chorus
Hate for love, is already inside
Hate for love, is already on
Tell it like you want it
Hate for love, is already inside

Bridge
Chosen by fate
Suspended into eternity

Chorus
Hate for love, is already inside
Hate for love, is already on
Tell it like you want it
Hate for love, is already inside
