Verse 1
Yesterday I went down to the sea
And asked the lord to have mercy
The kind that make you want no mercy no more
The kind that make you want no mercy no more

Pre-Chorus
Cause with you my life is one
Oh God have mercy

Chorus
Darling, have mercy, have mercy
On my lovely wife
We always seem to be one step ahead
But, always having to make the last choice in mercy, reason and mercy

Verse 2
The kind that make Christmas tales
For your children to hold
The kind that make you want no mercy no more
Angel of mercy, has your arms been so soft

Pre-Chorus
A nice place to start
When grace was not around

Chorus
Darling, have mercy, have mercy
On my lovely wife
We always seem to be one step ahead
But, always having to make the last choice in mercy, reason and mercy

Bridge
Yesterday I went down to the sea
And asked the lord for mercy

Chorus
Darling, have mercy, have mercy
On my lovely wife
We always seem to be one step ahead
But, always having to make the last choice in mercy, reason and mercy
