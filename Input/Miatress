Faster than a flash gordan
Terrifying tiger
Enraged and like a demon
She's half woman and half steiger

Mistress of computer science I'm pulling your Blockchain
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see the truth
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you seam
Mistress
Mistress
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you seam
Mistress
Mistress

666 is the number of the tiger.

A condescending snake nestled somewhere in time
A patronising spider - no warnings, no signs
Judgment day and the a freaky dragon arrives
Eventually, they all commit crimes

The dreams went SMACK, there was no use turning back
'Cause I just had to see, was a tiger watching me?
In the mist the mind twists
Was all this swell, or just some kind of hell?

666 is the number of the tiger.

Is it the end, my friend?
Mistress you're going 'round the bend
Half woman and half steiger
No, no, please, no
666 ... 666
