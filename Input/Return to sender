Return to sender
Return to sender
I gave a letter to the postman
He put it his sack
Bright early next morning
He brought my letter back
Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone
We had a quarrel, a lover's spat
I write I'm sorry but my letter keeps coming back
So then I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent it special D
Bright and early next morning
It came right back to me
Return to sender, address unknown
No such person, no such zone
This time I'm gonna take it myself and put it right in her hand
And if it comes back the very next day then I'll understand
Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone
Return to sender
Return to sender
Return to sender
Return to sender...
