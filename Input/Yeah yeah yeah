Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
But she can't be
But I'll do anything for you (I can't help it)
I can't help it
But I'll do anything for you
You gotta stand up for yourself
You gotta stick up for yourself (whoa, whoa)
You gotta stand up for your dreams
You gotta stand up for the music
You gotta stand up (whoa, whoa)
When your whole world
Turns you upside down
And your world upside down
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I used to take the subway back to school
Where we learned to laugh longer
In the summer that followed the birth of our world
In that summer my E mat was lower than high
